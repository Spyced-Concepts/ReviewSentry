## [Unreleased] — v0.2.0-alpha

### Added
- **Provider adapter architecture** — `scripts/adapters/` package; core `review.py` is now provider-agnostic with zero AI-vendor references; dispatches via `AI_PROVIDER` env var
- **Anthropic adapter** (`adapters/anthropic.py`) — extracted from original `review.py`; prompt caching retained
- **OpenAI adapter** (`adapters/openai.py`) — OpenAI Chat Completions API; also works with Groq, Azure OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama, and **GitHub Models** via `ai_base_url`
- **Gemini adapter** (`adapters/gemini.py`) — Google Gemini generateContent API
- **`ai_provider` input** — selects the adapter; default `anthropic` (backwards-compatible)
- **`ai_base_url` input** — optional base URL override for OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **`custom_rules` input** — user-definable sensitive data scan rules (FR-009)
- **Sensitive data disclosure scan** — always-on, always-first criterion (FR-008): credentials, personal identifiers, private paths, computer/host names, private repo names; severity-classified Critical → High → Moderate
- **GitHub Models support** — free AI code review using `GITHUB_TOKEN`; documented in `docs/setup-github-models.md`
- **Schema metadata** — YAML frontmatter in all `docs/setup-*.md` files (provider, adapter, cost, available models, complexity)
- **Provider setup docs** — `docs/setup-anthropic.md`, `docs/setup-openai.md`, `docs/setup-gemini.md`, `docs/setup-github-models.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **`SECURITY.md`** — includes per-provider data handling policy links, what data is transmitted, and user responsibility statement
- **Data Handling Notice** in `LICENSE` — explicit user responsibility clauses for third-party AI data transmission

### Changed
- `action.yml` description updated — leads with security-first and zero-cost positioning for GitHub Marketplace
- `README.md` rewritten — differentiation table, security-first positioning, GitHub Models as the zero-cost quick start, architecture diagram, provider comparison table
- Review criteria renumbered — sensitive data disclosure is criterion 1 (was absent in v0.1.0)

### Breaking change

**`ai_provider` is now required.** There is no default. This is an intentional choice — as an open-source, provider-agnostic tool we do not favour any particular AI. Existing workflows that did not set `ai_provider` will now fail with a clear error listing the supported providers.

**Migration:** add `ai_provider: anthropic` (or your chosen provider) to any workflow that previously omitted it.

### Changed
- Review criteria renumbered — sensitive data disclosure is now criterion 1 (was absent); all others shifted by one
- `review.py` docstring updated — removes AI-vendor references; reflects new adapter architecture

### Migration guide (v0.1.0 → v0.2.0)

No breaking changes. Existing workflows that don't set `ai_provider` default to `anthropic` and behave identically to v0.1.0. To opt in to a different provider, add `ai_provider: openai` (or `gemini`) to your workflow step.
